Randomly selected scenarios (from about 12)\r\n2. each scenario must be completed in under 5 seconds\r\n3. each difficulty level will reduce time available to complete scenario (level 2: 4 seconds, level 3: 3 seconds)\r\n4. Level 1 requires that 5 games are completed\r\n5. Level 2 requires that 6 games are completed\r\n6. Level 3 requires that 7 games are completed (this is the last level after which the game is over)\r\n7. High scores will be based on total time taken to finish\r\n\r\nThese are my game screen concepts.\r\n![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2moXBUtIcUk/VOONXUJvXeI/AAAAAAAAA-Q/380vZHzbFuM/s1600/BuildHouse.png)\r\n![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZGfOAHRS6YQ/VOONXejqXUI/AAAAAAAAA-U/0MSS5QE5_8k/s1600/BuildRobot.png)\r\n![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tFj_-sq6aKY/VOONXdMUHeI/AAAAAAAAA-M/Cd9k7hFCZIY/s1600/BuildDam.png)\r\n\r\n# My Production Plan\r\n* I am planning on doing the graphics in Pixel Art style.\r\n* I am planning on programming the gameplay using LibGDX (Java Framework)\r\n* I would like a sound engineer to assist with sounds and music.\r\n* Game will be playable on Mobile device and Desktop PC.\r\n* I have a list of Graphical Assets that someone can help me with producing.\r\n* I have a list of 12 Scenarios that a designer can help me with developing further.\r\n\r\n# Implemented Features\r\n* Basic Menu\r\n* Game Loop with one available Scenario ('Build House')\r\n* Tally Screen\r\n\r\n# Game Download\r\nVersion 0.2A - Desktop (Windows/Mac)\r\nVersion 0.1A - Desktop (Windows/Mac)\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\nJust extract ZIP and run JAR file (Java 1.7 Required)\r\n\r\n# About the Author\r\n* I am a Programmer by trade (mainly JS, Java and AS3), but I do dabble in the dark arts of MS Paint and Paint.net on occasion. \r\n* As a Game Designer, I have many game concepts, mostly recycled old ideas (but oldies are goldies).\r\n* Let me know if you need a hand with your projects as I am really revving up my part-time project work this year.\r\n* All the best of luck to y'all.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
